## basic python data structure - list
```
num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 26, 1996] ## list in python; in C++, it is called array/vector
print("whole list", num_list, 'Hello, Mincon!', 'Hello, Kuangdi', num_list[5])
print("6th element", num_list[5])
print('-----')
for i in num_list:
  print(i)
```
### how general array/python list look in memory

一个一个往后垒 

advantage: random access 

disadvantage: consume large chunk of memory

advantage: doesn't consume large chunk of memory 

disadvantage: no random access and have to visit one by one

## basic python data structure - dict
```
my_dict = {1: "a", 2:"b", 3:"c"} ##1,2,3 are keys; 'a','b','c' are values 
print(my_dict)
print(my_dict[3])
print('-------')
phonebook = {'KD': 666666, 'MC': 888888, 'ZM': 222222}
print(phonebook)
print(phonebook['ZM'])
print('-------')
for key, value in phonebook.items():
  print(key, value)
```

### hashing algo FYI 
cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the "message") to a bit array of a fixed size (the "hash value", "hash", or "message digest").a one way function. widely used in database indexing, compilers, caching, password authentication

To solve collison:a p
- Open addressing 如果预先分配的内存满了，再往里插入的话，会报错
    - linear probing
    - rehashing, eg plus 3
- Closed addressing
    - chaining 像list一样， collided往外找其他内存继续连，可以一直连， 更占内存
##### salt & pepper
a salt is a simple random value generated for each password. the processing of combining a password with a salt and then hashing them is called salting.

salting = hash(password+salt)

pepper is a random value and for everyone in the database, ie, it is a side-wide static value.

### complexicity 复杂度
#### time complexicity 
the time complexicity for hashtable insert and search is O(1) for most of the cases.
for collison, the worst case would be O(n)
for inserting more elements in open addressing(need to rehash from very beginning despite they have been allocated already), the step for expanding memory(when adding extra one element) is O(n). 
the time complexicity for search in list/array is O(n).

#### space comlexicity

### hashset 有一组数， 未来需要搜索， 用hashset 
```
example:
my_set = set()
my_set.add(2)
my_set.add(42)
my_set.add(4)
my_set.add(3)

if 3 in my_set:
    print("3 in my_set")
    

if 10 in my_set:
    print("10 in my_set")
else:
    print("10 not in my_set")

for i in my_set:
    print("set elem:", i)
```
